= Connection to GitLab

For the Lieutenant Operator to be able to connect to the GitLab API, the following configuration needs to be made.

== Get GitLab Token

. Visit the GitLab instance you'd like to use.
. Login with the user that has the permissions necessary to write to the group you want to store your Project Syn repositories.
. Visit `\https://yourgitlab/profile/personal_access_tokens` and create a token with the following settings:

== Add Secret with Endpoint Information

Before any other things can be created we need to specify the Git repository API endpoint first:

Provide a full SSH URL (for example `ssh://gitlab-ssh.example.com`) or just a host name.

[source,shell]
....
kubectl -n lieutenant create secret generic lieutenant-secret \
  --from-literal endpoint=http://10.144.1.197:8080 \
  --from-literal sshEndpoint=ssh://gitlab-ssh.example.com \
  --from-literal token=<token>
....
